Education:  
----------

* **University of California, Berkeley**
  * Major: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
  * YOG: 2017 
* **Relevant Coursework (by Spring 2015):**
  * CS61B - Data Structures
  * CS 61C – Machine Architecture
  * CS 70 – Discrete Math and Probability
  * Math 54 – Linear Algebra and Differential Equations
  * CS 170 – Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems  

Programming Languages:
---------------------- 
 * Python
 * Java
 * C
 * JavaScript
 * HTML, CSS
 * Ruby 

Work Experience:
----------------

* **Capital One Software Engineering Summit** (May 15 - May 22, 2015)
  * Was one of 30 Computer Science students chosen for a selective conference at Capital One's national headquarters. I went to a number of programming workshops and training seminars, networked with engineers and executives from Capital One, and took part in a rigorous hackathon, in which I, along with 4 others, presented my application to Capital One leadership.

* **Natero** (Internship: May 2015 - Present)
  * Currently working as a backend/infrastructre intern at Natero, a predictive analytics company in Mountain View, CA.  
 
* **Stanza.co** (Internship: May 2014 – August 2014)
  * Worked as a full stack engineer at a rapidly growing startup
  * Used diverse technologies as Node.js, Ember.js, MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch
  * Built out partnership with Ticketmaster; implemented their API into SpotOn’s calendar infrastructure
  * Handled a number of scaling issues including MongoDB query efficiency and Node.js request handling, as startup grew 300% during my stay
  * Pitched a number ideas to rest of team, many of which were incorporated into product

* **Gradescope** (October 2014-January 2015)
  * Worked part-time as a backend engineer at a growing company at the Berkeley SkyDeck
  * Used Ruby on Rails and Postgres SQL to create an admin dashboard for data visualization 

Projects:
---------

* **Recommendation Engine:** With a friend, I built a recommendation engine that uses the strength of user-created lists to provide strong book, music, and movie recommendations to users. We used the GoodReads API, an unofficial SoundCloud API, and an IMDB scraper, to get the data. We also used a Gearman Job Server to distribute the load, Cassandra to handle our task queue and record item location, and the graph database Neo4j to store the relationships between items. 
 
* **Subreddit Recommendation Engine:** I created a Recommendations Engine for Reddit sub-communities that uses a k-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm to determine the similarities between other users and the current user, and recommend subreddits from the taste of the most similar users to the inputted user.  
 
* **Stegosaurus:** With a friend, I built a Google Chrome extension that performs basic steganography by imperceptibly altering the RGB values of each pixel of an image by fixed amounts, and using these to encode messages into images and decode them. We wrote the algorithm in Go, the server in Python (Flask), and the extension in JS.
 
* **Ray Tracer:** For a school class, I built a Ray Tracer in C++ to simulate the effects of light upon a scene. The scene’s details are passed through an .obj file, and it’s then rendered, taking into account shadows, reflections, bouncing light rays, and nonlocal illumination to produce a very realistic image. We used a Phong Shading model and a recursive algorithm to follow right rays through the scene.
 
* **Movies with Friends:** I built an application that uses the Google Hangouts API to sync the playback of a video for all people in the video call. We used the Dropbox API as a way for the user to upload a video, and wrote the application entirely in JavaScript. This won second place at Hackjam 2014, Berkeley’s local hackathon.  
 
* **Reddit Markov Bot:** I made a Reddit Bot that analyzes your past comments, and uses a Markov Chain (along with a simple probability model) to generate comments that resemble your writing style. This was done entirely in Python, using the Reddit API.

* **Reddit Macro Bot:** I created a basic programming language that allows you to interact with real-time events on Reddit. This is implemented through a Reddit Bot, and can be interacted with by "summoning" the bot's username on Reddit, and writing a code block in the special, Python-esque syntax. 

* **Reimburse:** At a hackathon, my group made an Android App, an IPhone App, and a Web Platform to improve the process of travel reimbursements for companies and employees/interviewees. Instead of having to keep receipts, you can now just take a picture of your receipt on our mobile app. This is then sent to our OpenCV/Tesseract backend, which will use OCR and grab the price and the date, and store that in a database. The company can then open our web platform, and see all of your transactions, and approve them and pay with Stripe individually or all at once. 

And many more! I code too much to list everything I do.
